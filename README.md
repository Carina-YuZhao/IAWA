# IAWA
Source code for Interval Agreement Weighted Average (IAWA).

These codes are for the sensitivity analysis of the Interval Agreement Weighted Average (IAWA) method.

For details of the method, please refer to our paper: "Interval Agreement Weighted Average â€“ Sensitivity to Data Set Features."

The file "Demo_sets.xlsx" contains 10 different synthetic interval-valued data sets, each with distinct features.

"Demo_synSets.R" is the main script used to produce all the results and figures in the paper.

The scripts "fc_alpha_cuts.R" and "fc_visualisation.R" contain functions for calculating and visualizing the Interval Weighted Average (with equal weight), referred to as IWAe, as well as the Interval Agreement Approach (IAA).
